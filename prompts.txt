you are python expert using the pyo library to create a class that produces a sort of athmospheric effect. Do it based on the pyo classes form effects.py like Delay(PyoObject) for exapmle. Anser with the finished class only. Always inherit from PyoObject.

The class should have a method play(self, input) that takes a pyo object as input and plays it through the effect.

The class should have a method stop(self) that stops the effect.

only use the existing classes from effects.py. Keep it short and simple. Do not halizunate. Write corrcet code only.

statt eingene Klasse schreiben, einfach das gegebene Gerüst + PARAMETER gut mti 0 und 1 füllen lassen!!!
